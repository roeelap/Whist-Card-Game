## ISRAELI WHIST RULES
Israeli Whist is a four player card game.
A round begins by dealing out all the
cards (without jokers) to four players.
There are two rounds of bidding:
a round to determine the trump suit,
and a round to determine the contract.
The object of the game is to win the exact
number of tricks in the contract.


## BID FOR TRUMP SUIT
During the bidding that determines the
trump suit, each player can say "pass",
or to bid. Bidding includes the number
of future tricks given a certain trump suit.
The bid that determines the trump is the
one that after it there are three "passes"
in a row. If all four players say "pass"
a new round begins.


## BID FOR CONTRACT
After the trump suit is determined, there
is another bidding round in which the
"contracts" are determined. The player that
determined the trump suit, must declare the
number of tricks to be at least the number
he declared in the previous bidding round.
The last player is not allowed to make a bid
that makes the sum of all four bids 13.


## PUTTING DOWN CARDS
After the contracts are declared, the players
can start putting down cards. every time, the winner of the
previous round starts. every player must put down a card
that matches the suit of the starting card. if he doesn't
have any matching cards, he can put any card that he wants.


## SCORE
If a player makes his contract (with zero
as the exception), he receives the number
of tricks squared plus ten.
If a player does not make his contract
(with zero as the exception), he gets minus
ten points for each deviation from his"
contract.


## ZERO CONTRACT
A player that bids zero and makes it,
receives 50 points in an "under" game
(sum of bids is less than 13) and 25 in an
"over" game (sum of bids is more than 13).
A player that bids zero loses 50 points if
he wins one trick. If he wins more than
one trick, for each additional trick he won,
he receives 10 points.
